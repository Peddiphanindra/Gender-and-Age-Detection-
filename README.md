# Gender and Age Detection

A robust deep learning project that performs automated gender and age detection from facial images. This system utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision techniques with TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks, leveraging OpenCV for image preprocessing and real-time analysis.

## üîç Project Overview

This project aims to classify the **gender** (male/female) and estimate the **age** of individuals from images using deep learning models. It can be used for a wide range of applications, including analytics, targeted advertising, security, and demographic data collection.

## üìå Features

- Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV
- Predicts gender (Male/Female)
- Predicts age range (e.g., 0-2, 4-6, ..., 60-100)
- Supports both image and webcam input
- Built with TensorFlow and PyTorch for flexibility
- Easy to deploy and extend

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Models:** Pre-trained CNN models for age and gender classification
